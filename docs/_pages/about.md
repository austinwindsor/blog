The primary goal of these blog posts is to enable people unfamiliar with research in natural language generation to get an intuitive understanding of popular models and methods in order for them to be able to read and understand current literature in this area. In particular, we are covering topics such as automatic summarization and narrative generation in the deep learning era. We seek to make the learning process as painless as possible, and include links to blogs and explanations that we have found helpful, as well as code repositories where the reader can start getting some hands-on experience in generating natural language text.

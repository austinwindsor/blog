The primary goal of this blog is to help me structure my projects, goals and interests. At the same time, I hope that this can serve as a good introduction into my background, my thoughts, my projects, and my goals. I intend on updating this website whenever I finish a particularly interesting book/article for which I need to enshrine my interpretations, whenever I have significant updates on a technical or linguisitc endeavor, or whenever I get bored of the current site's aesthetic.

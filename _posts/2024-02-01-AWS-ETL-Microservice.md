## Why You Need This Solution

Managing large volumes of data and ensuring it is readily available for detailed analysis is a complex task. Traditional methods can be time-consuming, prone to errors, and resource-intensive. By leveraging AWS services, we can streamline this process, making it efficient, reliable, and scalable. Our expertise in setting up these microservices ensures that your business can focus on strategic decisions rather than data management.

## Technical Challenges

One of the primary challenges in providing detailed drilldown capabilities is managing the vast amounts of data required to account for all possible combinations. Most client environments lack the necessary tools to handle this efficiently. Our solution addresses these challenges head-on, ensuring seamless data processing and visualization.

## Our Approach

To overcome these challenges, we implement a serverless AWS ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) microservice that harnesses the power of various AWS services. Here’s a comprehensive guide on how we achieve this:

### Step 1: Set Up AWS RDS

Our first step is to ensure that your Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) instance is set up and configured correctly. This service will be the primary repository for your data. If you don’t have an RDS instance yet, we can assist in setting it up to meet your specific needs.

### Step 2: Schedule Lambda Function Calls with CloudWatch

AWS CloudWatch will be utilized to schedule Lambda functions that periodically query the RDS database to extract the latest data.

1. **Create a Lambda Function**:
    - We develop a Lambda function tailored to your requirements, ensuring it has the necessary permissions to access RDS and S3.
    - The function will be scripted to query your RDS database and fetch the required data efficiently.

2. **Schedule with CloudWatch**:
    - We configure CloudWatch rules to trigger your Lambda function at the desired intervals (e.g., weekly), ensuring timely data extraction.

### Step 3: Query RDS and Write Output to S3

Our Lambda function will handle the querying of your RDS and writing the output to an S3 bucket, making the data easily accessible.

- Using the AWS SDK, we connect to RDS, execute queries, and process results.
- We generate a CSV file from the results and upload it to an S3 bucket for storage and further use.

### Step 4: Send Report via SES

We use Amazon SES (Simple Email Service) to send email reports with a summary and attached CSV files, ensuring your team receives the information directly.

- We configure SES in your AWS account and verify the necessary email addresses.
- Our Lambda function is updated to trigger SES after uploading the CSV to S3, automating the email delivery process.


### Step 5: Visualize Data with QuickSight

To provide real-time data visualization, we use Amazon QuickSight. This service allows us to create detailed and interactive dashboards.

1. **Set Up QuickSight**:
    - We sign up for QuickSight and connect it to your S3 bucket, importing the CSV data.
    - QuickSight’s intuitive interface enables us to create and share visualizations that provide deep insights into your data.

## Deliverable

By following these steps, we deliver a fully automated, serverless AWS ETL microservice that runs weekly, providing your business teams with up-to-date, detailed reports. This solution includes email delivery of reports and powerful data visualizations, all managed without manual intervention.

## Areas to Stay

Taipei is a city of unique neighborhoods, each offering something different for visitors. 

Here are a few of the top areas to consider staying in:

- **Ximending**: Known as Taipei’s youthful and lively district, Ximending is great for nightlife, shopping, and street food. This of course is also accompanied by correlated issues: higher costs.
- **Daan**: A more relaxed area known for its parks, cafes, and the bustling Yongkang Street, which is famous for food. 
- **Zhongzheng**: Close to historical sites and museums, this area is perfect for culture seekers.
- **Xinyi**: Home to Taipei 101, Xinyi is a modern district filled with luxury shopping, high-end restaurants, and bars. This area is great for people seeking fine dining, roof top bars, lounges, etc.
- **Zhongshan**: An increasingly trendy part of town with plenty of indie cafes, vintage shopping, restaurants, izakaya, and movie theaters. On weekends, the Zhongshan Linear Park has a cute farmers market where young people like to hang out. 
- **Shilin**: Shilin is primarily known among tourists for its famous night market, but it also has plenty of other highlights. One of my favorites are museums, easy access to Yangmingshan (20-min bus), easy access to hot springs, plus plenty of resaurants and bars.
- **Beitou**: Beitou area is formally still part of Taipei city, but just barely. If you're looking to stay closer to mountains with easy access to the city, then the Beitou area is a great choice. Shipai station (in Beitou area) is a great compromise which has plenty of food options and easy access to the mountains; whereas Beitou station has fewer restaurants/bars, but instead leans heavily on Japanese architecture and hot spring culture to attact tourists. 

How to choose which are to stay in? In terms of convenience, Taipei is a relatively small city with incredible MRT (Mass Public Transit, read: the metro) that runs until 00:30, also cheap public bikes available 24/7 for shorter or late night travel. Furthermore, the first 30 min on these UBikes are free as of right now. 

Ultimately, you would recommend to prioritize in the following order: 1) the atmosphere you want to immerse yourself in, 2) convenient bike distance for any late night trips back home, 3) convient travel distance to where you want to spend oyur time exploring. 

## Pre-Arrival Tips

Before you arrive, here are a few important things to take care of:

- **Tourist Subsidy**: Taiwan occasionally offers subsidies for tourists visiting the island. Check for any active programs before your trip to save money. Please read here for more details to potentially win NTD$5,000: [How to apply for Taiwan's NT$5,000 prize for foreign tourists](https://taiwannews.com.tw/news/4879972)
- **Power Outlets**: Taiwan uses two-prong Type A outlets (the same as in the US), so bring an adapter if necessary, especially if your devices have a three-prong plug. 
- **International Driver’s License**: If you plan on renting a scooter or car, make sure you have an international driver’s license. You'll need to provde both your passport and your international driver's license to be eligible. This is essential if you're considering the popular activity 環島 Cycle Around Taiwan.

## Arrival Essentials

Upon landing in Taipei, you’ll want to take care of a few things right away:

- **SIM Card**: Get a local SIM card at the airport to stay connected throughout your trip. Taiwan offers affordable data plans. There are some options at the airport. The price differences aren't worth the trouble of waiting until getting to the city to claim. Althernatively, you can also consider an [[eSIM card](https://english.taiwanmobile.com/product/eSIMservice.html).
- **Tourist Subsidy**: If applicable, make sure to claim any tourist subsidies you are eligible for, which can include transportation or accommodation discounts. Read the link provided above for more details.

## Logistics: Getting Around

Taipei’s public transportation system is efficient and easy to navigate. Here’s what you need to know:

- **EasyCard**: The EasyCard is a must for navigating the MRT, buses, and YouBike. It can also be used at convenience stores.
- **MRT (Mass Rapid Transit)**: The MRT is the easiest way to get around the city. It’s fast, predicatble, clean, and covers most of Taipei’s key areas. Just keep in mind to try to avoid peak hours, especially 18:00-20:00 on the Blue Line. 
- **Buses**: The bus system complements the MRT and can take you to areas the MRT doesn't reach. It's also very convenient, but ride times are also easily affected by rain and rush hours.
- **Bikes**: YouBike is the public bike-sharing system. You can rent bikes with an EasyCard at numerous stations. Read more on [this link](https://taipeibikeworks.com/en/blog/how-to-use-taiwan-s-youbikes-in-8-steps) on how to download the app and use it.
- **Scooter Rental**: Scooters are a popular way to travel, but you'll need an international driver’s license. 
- **Train and High-Speed Rail**: If you plan to explore beyond Taipei, the train and High-Speed Rail (HSR) are convenient for traveling around Taiwan. Keep in mind that a bus might actually get you there both faster and cheaper than a train might.

## Accommodation Types

From luxury hotels to budget-friendly options, Taipei has accommodation to suit every traveler:

- **Sharehouses**: For longer stays, consider co-living spaces like [HSH Sharehouse](https://en.hshsharehouse.com/), [Borderless House](https://www.borderless-house.com/tw/), or [Banana Coliving](https://www.bananacoliving.com/).
- **Luxury Hotels**: Xinyi district is home to many high-end hotels like the W Taipei and Grand Hyatt.
- **Budget Hotels & Hostels**: For budget-conscious travelers, there are plenty of affordable hotels and hostels around Ximending and Daan.

## Must-Try Foods

Taipei is famous for its food scene, and there are several dishes you must try during your visit. For a full list of all the savory food suggestions, you can look at my [Savory Google Maps list](https://maps.app.goo.gl/YWEgZXt26MLGjN5k6); [Sweet Google Maps List](https://maps.app.goo.gl/S2q3k5vri3t2vffs5). A less overwhelming alternative is simply looking below for a few suggestions.

### Savory
- **Taiwanese Breakfast**: Taiwanese breakfast is not joke. An incredible way to start the day. I would recommennd your choice of egg pancake 蛋餅, taro patty　芋頭糕, soy milk　豆漿, pastry sandwich with an egg/fried fritter 燒餅加聰蛋油條. Some recommend places that requiring queuing an hour early in the morning, but any place near you is where you'd get a more local experience.
- **Xiao Long Bao 小籠包**: Soup dumplings, made famous by Din Tai Fung, are a must-eat in Taipei, most especially the truffle soup dumplings which are only sold in Taiwan's Din Tai Fung.
- **Beef Noodle Soup 牛肉麵**: Taiwan’s national dish, rich in flavor and comfort. Tbh, the two following links below both have good Beef Noodle Soup.
- **Beef Bone Broth Soup 清燉牛肉麵**: This rich and hearty soup is made by simmering beef bones for hours, resulting in a flavorful, nutrient-dense broth. Often served with tender slices of beef and vegetables, it’s a comforting dish that showcases the depth of Taiwanese cuisine. Check out my favorite at [18冠軍牛肉麵](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tFHvx1Zqe7g3TqFs8).
- **Sauerkraut Pork Noodle Soup　酸菜白肉麵**: A unique fusion of flavors, this soup combines tender slices of pork with tangy Taiwanese-style sauerkraut in a savory broth. The noodles add a chewy texture, while the pickled vegetables give it a refreshing, sour twist, making it a perfect comfort food for cooler days. Check out my favorite at [Héhuān Dāoxiāomiàn 合歡刀削麵館](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1G9H17f188KiKDdDA). Please bear in mind that you may want to start queuing about 15 min before opening time to get this, but I find it's worth the wait. 
- **Fish Ramen**: Not a Taiwanese specialty, but a must-eat in my mind. At this point, the boss recognizes me, so show him a picture of who recommended you! I'm curious to hear his reaction haha. Check it out at [魚仔麵](https://maps.app.goo.gl/cAd65dLxR68L6v8k9).
- **Stinky Tofu 臭豆腐**: Not for the faint of heart, but a Taiwanese street food favorite. This is great freshly fried in any night market with some Taiwanese sauerkraut and a beer, but you can check out my favorite at [戴記臭豆腐專賣店](https://maps.app.goo.gl/4EZtcfZKP3WkzwA46). If you're really daring, you can try either the Cold Stinky Tofu 涼拌臭鬥 or the Pigs/Ducks Blood Mala Stinky Tofu Soup 豬/鴨血麻辣臭豆腐湯.
- **Braised Pork Rice 滷肉飯**: Known locally as *lu rou fan 滷肉飯*, this comforting dish consists of tender braised pork belly served over steamed rice, topped with a savory soy-based sauce. It's a staple of Taiwanese street food.
- **Scallion Pancakes 蔥油餅**: Crispy on the outside and flaky on the inside, scallion pancakes (*cong you bing*) are a popular savory snack in Taiwan. These pan-fried pastries are packed with the bold flavor of fresh green onions. The most famous one is in Dongmen [天津蔥抓餅](https://maps.app.goo.gl/569wScqAFWenA4tY9), but you can't go wrong with most places as long as it's not too oily.
- **Cold Noodles with Sesame Paste　涼麵**: A refreshing and flavorful dish, cold noodles with sesame paste (*liang mian*) are a perfect balance of chewy noodles tossed in a creamy, nutty sesame sauce. Often topped with shredded cucumber, carrots, and a drizzle of soy sauce or vinegar, it’s a light yet satisfying meal, especially popular during Taiwan’s hot summer months. Check out my favorite at [芝鄉涼麵](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qtVqbPLuEESxmUC28). Make sure to add a miso soup to complement the noodles!
- **Gua Bao　刮包**: Often referred to as a Taiwanese hamburger, *gua bao* is a soft steamed bun filled with tender braised pork belly, pickled mustard greens, peanuts, and fresh cilantro. It’s a perfect balance of savory, sweet, and tangy flavors.
- **Pork Pepper Bun　胡椒餅**: This crispy baked bun, filled with juicy pork marinated in a mix of soy sauce, sugar, and white pepper, is a street food favorite. The outer shell is flaky and crunchy, while the inside bursts with flavor. My favorite is located in Ruifang, which is pretty far. Alternatively, go to the most famous one in Raohe Night Market.
- **Oyster Omelette**: A Taiwanese night market classic, the *oyster omelette* combines fresh oysters with eggs and a gooey starch mixture, all topped with a sweet and savory sauce. It’s a textural adventure in every bite.
- **TFC (Taiwanese Fried Chicken)　鹹酥雞**: Crispy, juicy, and often seasoned with garlic and spices, Taiwanese fried chicken is a popular street snack. It's served in bite-sized pieces with optional seasoning powders, like chili or plum.
- **Oyster Vermicelli**: This savory bowl of thin vermicelli noodles, cooked in a rich broth and mixed with fresh oysters, is a Taiwanese comfort food. It’s often topped with cilantro and vinegar to balance the flavors.
- **Taiwanese Sausage　山豬香腸**: Sweet and savory, Taiwanese sausages are grilled and served on skewers. They’re often paired with raw garlic cloves for a burst of flavor, making them a go-to snack at night markets.
- **Danzai Noodles　擔仔麵**: Originating from Tainan, *danzai* noodles are a light yet flavorful dish of chewy wheat noodles in a shrimp and pork broth, topped with minced pork, shrimp, and a boiled egg. This simple yet delicious bowl has been a Taiwanese favorite for over a century.


### Sweet
- **Shaved Ice　雪花冰／剉冰／刨冰**: The ultimate summer dessert, which often gets categorized into two types: Snow ice and shaved ice. The former is finer and melts into a smooth almost cream-like texture, by far my preferred type. The latter is more traditional and coarser, almost like a Hawaiian ice. Check out [this place](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xreaDaSKPiiyaFbWA) for a very unique green bean snow ice, [here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5EXr88SWaqCs6s3f7) for a unique Mensona Grass Jelly snow ice, [here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/womXzejo4dprSXL16) for tea flavored shaved ice, and [here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2Z88gkTerNENcbjv6) for more commonly seen flavors.
- **Tiramisu**: Not Taiwanese at all, but the best tiramisu I've had in the whole world is [here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/PefFTVuBiEgTNZibA). Very heavy handed on the alcohol. Go ahead and order a orange rum hot chocolate to go with it as well! They also recognize me here, so lemme know how they react if you show a picture haha!
- **Mochi on Shaved Ice**: This dessert plays on difference in textures and temperatures with freshly boiled chewy mochi on top of freshly shaved snow ice. Traditionally, it will come with black sesame and/or peanut flavors. You can check out my favorite which also comes with osmantus syrup at [Yu Pin Yuan Iced and Hot Tangyuan 御品元冰火湯圓](https://maps.app.goo.gl/uz1jGu62nAoXHmzz5).
- **Peanut Cilantro Ice Cream Roll**: A unique Taiwanese dessert, this refreshing treat wraps scoops of ice cream, shaved peanut brittle, and fresh cilantro in a thin crepe. The combination of flavors and textures is surprisingly delicious!
- **Bubble Tea　珍珠奶茶**: Taiwan is the birthplace of bubble tea. Try it at original spots like Chun Shui Tang. My personal favorite is in Shilin with a avocado milk cap on top [大茗本位製茶堂](https://maps.app.goo.gl/JBT2on9RZ3GQt4KeA).
- **Pineapple Cake　鳳梨酥**: A must-try Taiwanese delicacy, pineapple cakes are sweet and crumbly pastries filled with a tangy pineapple jam, usually accompanied with tea to offset the sweetness. They are a popular souvenir for tourists and a delightful treat with tea. I definintely recommned to buy a lot to take home for friends and family! You can buy at [Chia Te Bakery](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8Xeu2hbTi8Ucqb948) or [Sunny Hills](https://maps.app.goo.gl/FRJAKBek5sHtVzo16) for a less sweet option.
- **Tofu Pudding 豆花**: This very traditional dessert is perhaps the mostly commonly eaten dessert in Taiwan. Soft Tofu in either a brown sugar water or soy milk for a less sweet option, plus you choice of additional ingredients. My personal go to are green beans　綠豆, pearled barley　薏仁, and taro balls 芋園. This is found every where essentially. [Here's](https://maps.app.goo.gl/FyRF7in15rW1s6tC9) an interested place if you like cilantro.
- **Egg Tarts 蛋塔**: Honestly, KFC's egg tarts slap. I whole heartedly recommend people to hop into the closest KFC and try and egg tart. 


## Cafes to Enjoy

Taipei has a thriving cafe culture, perfect for relaxing between sightseeing. Taipei has a thriving cafe culture that plays on nonstalgic interior designs, often harkening back to Japanese colonial era or leaning on natural themes. An interesting difference in cafes in Taipei is that most cafes have explicit time limits and miminal spending per person baked into the establishment rules. This appears to be in reaction to people working, watching tv or sleeping too long in cafes, ultimately influencing their business.

My list of cafes is really too long to go into here, but you can check out my [Cafe Google Map List](https://maps.app.goo.gl/T7Mb6Hhz6F3QTaHt8) or take a look at my favorite cafe [2J CAFE](https://maps.app.goo.gl/kDRjTSLVSSfengvj6). In general, I recommend trying a Sicily Coffee if you've never had one before: Americano mixed with lemonade instead of water for a sweet and tart afternoon refreshment! 

## Nightlife: Clubs & Bars
